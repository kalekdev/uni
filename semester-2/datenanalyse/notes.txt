Usually the following suffices:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
Use plt.subplots to create a figure and axes simultaneously
np.fft.rfft is usually good, since we mostly work with real signals
ax.hist handles binning and plotting for you
ax.set_xlabel to set axes labels
ax.set_xlim to zoom into axis
