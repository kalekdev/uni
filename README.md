# Electrical Engineering Notes
Various notes, exercises and derivations made during my BSc in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (Started September 2024) at ETH ZÃ¼rich, mainly using [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern feature-rich replacement for LaTeX.

Lecture scripts / textbooks already explain the general ideas much better than I can, hence the notes consist mainly of points that particularly stood out to me and are not written with the goal of being a useful learning resource, rather for personal use during revision.
