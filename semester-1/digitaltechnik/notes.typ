_MSB_ - Most significant bit\
_LSB_ - Least significant bit

$x % 1$ - drop decimal value from $x$.\
$2^n$ - number of possible states with $n$ bits.\

=== Resistance of a wire
$rho$ - resistivity of the metal ($ohm m$)\
$l$ - length of the wire\
$A$ - cross sectional area of the wire\
$R=(rho l)/A$

Modern electronics uses 0.8V as high.
